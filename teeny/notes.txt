Model 200 teeny loader

teeny-linux has a bug where the BASIC code that it sends to the client after it detects a Model 200 is missing a ":", and so the code dies with a syntax error.
This makes it impossible to install teeny on a Model 200, because there is no other way to get the Model 200 version of the loader out of the executable except by running it, and having the Model 200 respond as expected.

I was able to get TEENY.200 this way:

First make a new directory to work in, download dl-arc.exe, and use dosbox to run it.

  mkdir dl
  cd dl
  wget http://ftp.whtech.com/club100/com/dl-arc.exe
  dosbox dl-arc.exe

This executes dl-arc.exe which extracts itself into the current directory.
Among the extracted files are TEENY.EXE, but don't run it yet...
Type "exit" to exit out of dosbox.

Get the location of the dosbox config file from the on-screen messages it wrote when it started up:
  CONFIG:Loading primary settings from config file /home/bkw/.dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3.conf

Assuming your serial device tty is /dev/ttyUSB0 ,
edit the config file above, and find the [serial] section.

Change this line:
  serial1=dummy

to this:
  serial1=directserial realport:ttyUSB0

Now run TEENY.EXE:
  dosbox TEENY.EXE

Follow the prompts in TEENY.EXE and on the Model 200 screen, except at the end, save the loader BASIC code on the Model 200:
  SAVE "TNY200",A

This will create a file "TNY200.DO" on the Model 200.

Follow the remaining prompts to CLEAR 0,#####, exit to the main menu, and run TEENY.CO from the main menu on the Model 200.
TEENY.EXE will have automatically started up DeskLink at this point,
so there should now be a TPDD server running in dosbox on the hos pc,
which TEENY on the Model 200 should be able to talk to.

Use TEENY to save TNY200.DO back to the host.
In TEENY, type this:
  S TNY200.DO
  Q

You should now have TNY200.DO on the host pc in the dl directory with all the other dl-arc.exe files.
Now you can exit out of desklink and dosbox on the pc.
Rename TNY200.DO to TEENY.200 and save it wherever.
